# This is how you 'define' variables
this_is_a_number = 12
this_is_also_a_number = 12.2

# The first one is an integer (whole number). The second one is a floating
# point numer, called a 'float'. It just means a decimal

# Here are some other types of variables
this_is_a_bool = True
this_is_string = 'hello!'

# These are all the basic types in python. We'll can make more complex things
# soon

# You can print all the basic types like this
print(this_is_a_number)
print(this_is_also_a_number)
print(this_is_a_bool)
print(this_is_string)

# You can also 'redefine' variables later
this_is_a_number = 'something else'
this_is_also_a_number = 'something else'
this_is_a_bool = 'something else'
this_is_string = 'something else'

# And they don't need to be the same type. For example, you can reassign a
# boolean value to be a string
print('\n--- Now you try ---\n')

# Make a string called 'my_name' and assign it your name

# Make two different variables called 'a' and 'b' and store numbers in them

# Now make a variable called c and assign them 'a + b'

# Print 'my_name' and 'c'
